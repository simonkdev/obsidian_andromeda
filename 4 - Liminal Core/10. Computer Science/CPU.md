##### Overview:
The CPU (central processing unit) fetches program instructions from memory (see [[Memory and Pointers]]), decodes them into instructions supplied by its ISA (instruction set architecture), executes the decoded instructions and produces results for the next instructions (stored in registers/memory/flags). The main piece of software interacting with the CPU is the [[kernel]].
