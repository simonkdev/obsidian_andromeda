General:

in general, a cross-compiler is a compiler that runs on platform A (host) but generates executables for platform B (target). They may have different CPUs, OSs and / or executable formats.

Why?

Compiler on host only knows how to compile for host as target, cross-compiler is better since it can compile for different platform

Example: GCC (GNU Cross Compiler)
