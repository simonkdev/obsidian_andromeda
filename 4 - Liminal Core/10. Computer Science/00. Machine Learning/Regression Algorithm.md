##### Overview:
A regression algorithm trains a model to predict a number based on a dataset of known input-output mappings. The number can be of any size, therefore the amount of possible outputs is infinite. 

##### Different types:
1. *linear regression*:
	plots a line through the dataset, graphically: a one-dimensional line in a two-dimensional coordinate system
2. *multiple linear regression*:
	basically a linear regression with more dimensions. Upwards of 3 dimensions, it can not be visualized
3. *polynomial regression*:
	Non-linear graph, adds Potenzen to the equations
