##### Overview:
Unlike in supervised learning, where a model is trained by giving it a combination of inputs x and outputs y, an unsupervised learning model determines an output y from the input dataset x based on factors it discovers itself. 
The algorithm attempts to discover hidden patterns, structures, or groupings in the data.
What the output looks like or which factors are used is determined by the used algorithm.

##### Example goals:
- Clustering groups similar items.
- Dimensionality reduction simplifies data while retaining structure.
- Association rule learning finds relationships between variables.
