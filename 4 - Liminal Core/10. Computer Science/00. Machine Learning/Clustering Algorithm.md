##### Overview:
A clustering algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that groups the unlabeled data into clusters. The model has to figure out which ones belong together on its own, without being given or having to return the "right" answer. Basically, the algorithm groups data points based on similarity or distance metrics, so that points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

#### Example:
Google News groups together articles about the same event, which it determines by clustering them into groups. For example, this story about twin panda cubs in Japan was grouped because the headlines used the same words:

*HINT: The actual model decides this based on numerical representations, not the words in themself*

##### Probabilities:
While some algorithms assign each point to one cluster, some others are probability-based (similar to classification algorithms)
