##### Overview:
Pointers are memory addresses that contain the location of stored data, usually variables. 

- To access the pointer of a variable, the & operator is used, e.g. `&age` 
- A pointer variable is declared as the data type it points to with an asterisk (`*`), e.g.: `int*`, `char*`, etc.
- A pointer is an 8 byte value.
- To access the value stored at the pointer location, the asterisk is used in front of the pointer name, e.g.: `*ptr`
