#### Overview:
These are two different ways a function is called in programming. 

##### Synchronous:
The operation/function must complete before the next one starts. Until then, the further execution is blocked. A fully synchronous block of code runs top-to-bottom.

##### Asynchronous:
The operation is started and the program moves on without waiting for it to finish. Later, it is notified via callbacks or [[Promises]] to know when it is done.
