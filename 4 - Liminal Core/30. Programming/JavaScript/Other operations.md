##### Assignments: 
`number = number + 10` does the same as `number += 10`

##### Comments:
// single line
/* 
multi -line
(star)/

##### String operations:
- **Length**
	string1 = "dart";
	console.log(string1.length); // returns 4 (int)
- **Concatenation**:
	string1 = "stupid"
	"Tommy is " + string1 + " as hell"
- **Interpolation**:
	string1 = "stupid"
	'Tommy is ${string1} as hell´
	
	HINT: can also be used for e.g. ternarys, example: 
	`mail = ´The Parcel was ${ (received == true) ? "successfully sent": "failed to send"}´

	HINT: you have to use these ´ ´ for strings with interpolation
